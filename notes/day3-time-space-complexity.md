# 🗓️ Day 3: Time and Space Complexity

📺 **Video Link:** [Time and Space Complexity](https://youtu.be/Fo2Qnw5pMGo?si=ZHuu80snvFhWhO7s)

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- How an Algorithm Performance is measured?


## 💡 Takeaways
- Algorithm analysis is the process of understanding how efficient an algorithm is
-Time complexity measures how the running time of an algorithm increases as the input grows.[O(n)]
-Space complexity measures how much extra memory the algorithm uses as the input size grows.



## 📝 Notes
- In representing Algorithm we have worst case , best case and average case complexity
