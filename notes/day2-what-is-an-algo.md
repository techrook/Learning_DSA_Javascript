## 🧠 Key Concepts
- What is  Algorithms?


## 💡 Takeaways
- An Algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem
- An Algorithm must have an Input and output


## 📝 Notes
- One problem can be solve with different algorithm.
- Always use well defined Input and Outputs
-Each steps should be clear and unambigous
- A good Algorith should be language independent
