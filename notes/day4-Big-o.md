## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Big-o Notation?


## 💡 Takeaways
- Big-O Notation helps measure an algorithm's efficiency by describing:
How long it takes to run (Time Complexity)
How much memory it uses (Space Complexity)
-Efficiency dependent on input size (n)

## 📝 Notes
- n is the size of input 
- Time Complexity: O(1)- Constant time, O(n)- linear time
- Space Complexity : O(1) constant memory , O(1) linear memory
